## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a backend developer with solid experience in designing, building, and maintaining APIs using Django, PostgreSQL, and Redis. This repository serves as a collection of projects and ideas that demonstrate my approach to scalable and efficient backend systems.

My primary focus is on creating clean, well-documented APIs that are easy to use and integrate. Iâ€™ve worked extensively with Django and Django REST Framework to build robust application logic, secure authentication systems, and optimized database models. I place strong emphasis on writing maintainable code, following industry best practices, and ensuring that APIs are both performant and secure.

I use PostgreSQL as my go-to relational database for its reliability, flexibility, and strong support for complex queries. Combined with Djangoâ€™s ORM, it allows me to design data models that are both expressive and efficient. I also incorporate Redis where needed for caching, queuing, or temporary data storage, particularly in high-performance or real-time scenarios.

This repository includes both in-progress and completed backend projects that reflect my learning and growth. Some are API-first designs, while others include backend infrastructure built for web or mobile applications. I also enjoy exploring deployment strategies, containerization with Docker, and using tools like Celery for asynchronous task handling.

Iâ€™m always looking to improve, whether it's optimizing query performance, refining architecture patterns, or implementing better error handling and logging. Collaboration and feedback are welcomeâ€”if you see something interesting or have suggestions, feel free to reach out or contribute.

Thanks for stopping by and checking out my work. I hope these projects offer value, insight, or inspiration for your own development journey.
